						Hi there, my name is Katie King, and I am the proud owner of Mane
						Frame Photography. Ever since I was a child, I have been captivated
						by the beauty and majesty of horses. As I grew older, I discovered a
						love for photography, and it wasn't long before I realized that
						combining these two passions was my true calling. <br />
						Over the years, I have honed my skills as an equine photographer,
						and I am now considered one of the most talented and sought-after
						photographers in the industry. I am dedicated to capturing the
						essence of each horse I photograph, from their distinctive
						personalities to their unique physical characteristics. My goal is
						to create images that not only showcase the beauty and grace of
						horses but also evoke a deep emotional connection with those who
						view them.
						<br />
						At Mane Frame Photography, my team and I strive to provide our
						clients with an unforgettable experience. We work closely with our
						clients to understand their vision and create images that exceed
						their expectations. Whether you're looking for a stunning portrait
						of your equine companion or action shots of horses in motion, we
						have the expertise and passion to bring your vision to life. <br />
						Thank you for considering Mane Frame Photography for your equine
						photography needs. We look forward to the opportunity to work with
						you and capture the beauty of your beloved horses in stunning
						photographs.
