# Mane Frame Photography

### This project was developed with the intent of my college Capstone, a 10 week challenge, and was meant to demonstrate my abilities by developing a project by myself

This website is a simple demo of an e-commerce website. There's three different views, all users, clients, and admins.

I made this with Reactjs, Nodejs/Expressjs backend, and a Mongodb database. I pulled in a lot of node packages for various things

# Future Roadmap
    [] Move away from local storage to either sessions or cookies
    [] Go through all files and code and restructure to be cleaner and more organized
