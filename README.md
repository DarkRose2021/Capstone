# Mane Frame Photography

This website is a simple demo of an e-commerce website. There's three different views, all users, clients, and admins.

I made this with Reactjs, Nodejs/Expressjs backend, and a Mongodb database. I pulled in a lot of node packages for various things

I'm hoping to move this from using local storage to something better, either cookies or sessions
